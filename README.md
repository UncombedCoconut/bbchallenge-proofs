# BBChallenge proofs

For [The Busy Beaver Challenge](https://bbchallenge.org) to be successful we want to formally prove as many of the challenge's results as possible.

This includes:
- Proving the correctness of [deciders](https://bbchallenge.org/method#deciders) (https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-deciders)
- Proving the non-halting/halting of specific individual machines that are not covered by deciders

Please see our [reproducibility and verifiability statement](https://bbchallenge.org/method#reproducibility-and-verifiability-statement) for more. 

## PDFs

This repository stores latex sources of the proofs only. The corresponding compiled PDFs are available at http://docs.bbchallenge.org/bbchallenge-proofs.

## Future work: using theorem provers

At the moment we focus on writing standard plain-English proofs but future work includes a translation to formal proof systems such as [lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) or [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
