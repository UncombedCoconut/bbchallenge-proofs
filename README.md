# BBChallenge proofs

For [The Busy Beaver Challenge](https://bbchallenge.org) to be successful there is a need to formally prove that its results are correct.

This includes:
- Proving the correctness of [deciders](https://bbchallenge.org/method#deciders) (https://github.com/bbchallenge/bbchallenge-deciders)
- Proving the non-halting/halting of specific individual machines that are not covered by deciders

Please see our [reproducibility and verifiability statement](https://bbchallenge.org/method#reproducibility-and-verifiability-statement) for more.
