  abstract   = {The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists. In this survey, I o er a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems. Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function rst exceed the Ackermann function? Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory? Can we prove that BB(n + 1) > 2BB(n) for large enough n? Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n + 1)? Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input? Is it decidable, given n, whether BB(n) is even or odd?},

  abstract = {We consider theories of linear and of polynomial algebra, over two scalar systems, often called max-algebra and min-algebra. Here, max-algebra is the system M = (R ∪ {−∞}, ⊛, ⊗) where x ⊛ y = max(x, y) and x ⊛ y = x + y. Min-algebra is the dual system M′ = R ∪ {+∞}, ⊛, ⊗′ with x ⊛′ y = min(x, y) and x ⊗′ y = x + y. Towards the end we also consider minimax algebra, the system M″ = (R ∪ {−∞, +∞}, ⊛, ⊗, ⊛′, ⊗′). Application fields discussed include location problems, machine scheduling, cutting and packing problems, discrete-event systems and path-finding problems.}
