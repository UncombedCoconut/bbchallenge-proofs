\subsection{Characterising bouncers}

Intuitively, a \emph{bouncer} is a Turing machine that populates a tape with
linearly-expanding patterns, called \textit{repeaters}, possibly separated or enclosed by fixed patterns called \textit{walls}. This intuitive definition corresponds to a wide range of behaviors, from simply bouncing back and forth between the tape's expanding extremities, Figure~\ref{fig:bouncers}~(a), to more complex bouncers that exhibit intricate \textit{repeaters} or \textit{wall} patterns, Figure~\ref{fig:bouncers}~(b)-(d), and that possibly start \textit{bouncing} repetitively only after a certain number of steps, Figure~\ref{fig:bouncers}~(e).

The goal of this section is to formally characterise bouncers and show that they do not halt, see Theorem~\ref{th:bouncers}.

\subsubsection*{Directional Turing machines}

We build on the concept of directional Turing machine introduced in Section~\ref{sec:conventions}. Directional Turing machines are an equivalent formulation of Turing machine where the machine head lives in between the tape cells and can point to the left or to the right. We choose here to treat $0^\infty$ as a unique symbol (instead of an infinite collection of 0s) and write $\bar{\Sigma} = \{0^\infty\}\cup\Sigma$. For each Turing machine with set of state $S$ we introduce 2$|S|$ new configuration symbols (i.e. symbols used to describe machine configurations and not read/write symbols) denoting the machine head in two possible orientations, namely $\Delta = \{\lhead s | s\in S\}\cup\{\rhead s| s \in S\}$.

We define a \textit{tape} to be a finite word of the form $uhv$, where $u,v\in\bar{\Sigma}^*$ and $h\in\Delta$, moreover, $u$ and $v$ must have at most one occurrence of $0^\infty$ each, respectively as first symbol for $u$ or last symbol for $v$. We choose the initial tape to be $0^\infty \rhead{\text{A}} 0^\infty$. Now, we define tape rewrite rules which will be used to simulate a directional Turing machine which we fix from now on. Given two tapes $t$ and $t'$, a rewrite rule transforming $t$ into $t'$ will be denoted by $t\to t'$. The transitive closure of $\vdash$ (i.e. applying several successive $\vdash$ operations) is noted $\vdash^*$.

Suppose that for $s\in S, x\in \Sigma$ we have $\delta(s,x) = (s',d,x')$ where $s'\in S, d \in \{\text{L},\text{R}\}, x' \in \Sigma$ and $\delta$ the transition function of the machine, then we define the following tape rewrite rules:


\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        If $d = \text{L}$                               & If $d = \text{R}$ \\
        \hline
        $\begin{aligned}[t]
                 x \lhead{s}\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, \lhead{s'} x' \\
                 \rhead{s} x\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, \lhead{s'} x'
             \end{aligned}$ & $\begin{aligned}[t]
                                   x \lhead{s}\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, x' \rhead{s'} \\
                                   \rhead{s} x\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, x' \rhead{s'}
                               \end{aligned}$     \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}\\
    \ \\ If $x=0$, also define: \\
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \hline
        $\begin{aligned}[t]
                 0^\infty \lhead{s}\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, 0^\infty \lhead{s'} x'   \\
                 \rhead{s} 0^\infty\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, \lhead{s'} x'\, 0^\infty
             \end{aligned}$ & $\begin{aligned}[t]
                                   0^\infty \lhead{s}\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, 0^\infty \, x' \rhead{s'} \\
                                   \rhead{s} 0^\infty\,\,\, & \to \,\,\, x' \rhead{s'} 0^\infty
                               \end{aligned}$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}\\
\end{table}

Given a tape $t=uvw$ and a word $t'=uv'w$, with $u,w\in\bar{\Sigma}^*$, $v,v' \in (\bar \Sigma \cup \Delta)^*$, suppose that there is a rewrite rule $v \to v'$. Then $t'$ is also a tape and in this situation we write $t \vdash t'$ meaning that $t'$ is obtained from $t$ by one simulation step (i.e. $\vdash$ has the same meaning as for standard, non-directional, Turing machines, as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:conventions}); note that the definition is sound because, to any given tape, at most one rewrite rule applies, hence $v \to v'$ is defined uniquely and so is $t \vdash t'$.

\begin{example}
    Consider \texttt{bbchallenge} machine\footnote{Accessible at \url{https://bbchallenge.org/88427177}} \#88,427,177 (Figure~\ref{fig:bouncers}~(d)), that has the following transition table:
    \[
        \begin{array}{l|ll}
              & 0          & 1          \\
            \hline
            A & 1\text{RB} & 1\text{LE} \\
            B & 1\text{LC} & 1\text{RD} \\
            C & 1\text{LB} & 1\text{RC} \\
            D & 1\text{LA} & 0\text{RD} \\
            E & \mbox{---} & 0LA
        \end{array}
    \]

    Given the above definitions, we will have the following rules with state A on the left-hand side:
    \begin{align*}
        0 \lhead{A}\,\,\,        & \to\,\,\, 1 \rhead{B}          \\
        \rhead{A} 0\,\,\,        & \to\,\,\, 1 \rhead{B}          \\
        1 \lhead{A}\,\,\,        & \to\,\,\, \lhead{E} 1          \\
        \rhead{A} 1\,\,\,        & \to\,\,\, \lhead{E} 1          \\
        0^\infty \lhead{A}\,\,\, & \to\,\,\, 0^\infty 1 \rhead{B} \\
        \rhead{A} 0^\infty\,\,\, & \to\,\,\, 1 \rhead{B} 0^\infty
    \end{align*}
    The other rules are those with left-hand side states B, C, D and E. Simulating the machine for 4 steps, starting from initial tape yields:
    $$ 0^\infty \rhead{\text{A}} 0^\infty \;\vdash\; 0^\infty \, 1 \rhead{\text{B}} 0^\infty \;\vdash\; 0^\infty \, 1 \lhead{\text{C}} 1\, 0^\infty\ \;\vdash\; 0^\infty \, 1 \rhead{\text{C}} 1\, 0^\infty \;\vdash\; 0^\infty \, 1 1 \rhead{\text{C}} 0^\infty$$

    Hence, $0^\infty \rhead{\text{A}} 0^\infty \;\vdash^*\; 0^\infty \, 1 1 \rhead{\text{C}} 0^\infty$.
\end{example}




\begin{theorem}\label{th:bouncers}
    Assume we are given some Turing machine and suppose there exists a tape $t$ and some formula-tapes $f_0,\dots,f_n, n\geq 1$, such that $0^\infty \rhead{\text{A}} 0^\infty \vdash^* t$ where $t \in M(f_0)$, and $A(f_i) \vdash f_{i+1}$ for $i=0,\dots,n-1$. If $A(f_n)$ is a special case of $A(f_0)$, then the Turing machine does not halt and is called a \textit{bouncer}.
